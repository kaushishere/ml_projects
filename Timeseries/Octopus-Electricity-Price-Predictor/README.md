# About
Octopus, one of UK's belove energy suppliers, offers variable rate tariffs. You can find historical half-hourly electricity prices at https://agile.octopushome.net/historical-data.<p>
This project aims to demonstrated the quality of AWS Sagemaker's built-in forecasting algorithm, DeepAR. A DeepAR model will be trained to predict a week's worth of electricity export prices, given a preceding week's worth of data. <p>

# Who is this for?
Homeowners with battery storage may find this model/tool useful as a means of planning when to export stored energy back to grid and maximise income.
